# *And it doesn't look good* #

Today, I was asked to be power of attorney for my ailing father. To be honest, I have no idea if I can handle something like that. And it sucks, but not for the reason you'd think. It sucks because (I know this sounds selfish), I have to handle it. I don't have the luxury of running away, because this is actual life or death. But through all this pain, he's become a better man. And it's a beautiful thing.

# *And my Aunt's health is failing* #

Two weeks ago, I had to leave work because my Aunt was in a diabetic coma. I had to drive my Grandmother into Manhattan, and watch her cry as she held her eldest daughter's limp hand. I had to hide this from my mother for hours, so she didn't have to leave work to handle things. But, I've gotten closer to my family. And I met a nice old Brazillian woman in a Starbucks, and listened to her life story. Both are beautiful things.

# *And my cat refuses to eat* #

Today, I looked into her eyes and saw the fragility in her soul. She uncharacteristically got in my bed this morning, and came up to me to snuggle. She's unstable on her feet, and I have to watch my family struggle in vain to try and feed her. I have to watch my mom resign to losing another cat, and I have to lose a friend. But kitty has been getting more affectionate, and I feel like I'm bringing her peace of mind. And that's a beautiful thing.


## *And life fucking blows* ##

### **But That's A Beautiful Thing.** ###
Life is to suffer, to suffer by loving, by watching beloveds suffer.  
Suffering is a path to growth, to grow by enduring, by helping beloveds endure.  
Growth is a journey, a journey of love a journey of suffering.  
To Journey is Life. And Life is a Beautiful Journey.
