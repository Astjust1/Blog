This is just a rambling about how fragility affects different aspects of our lives. Based solely on my own personal observatons

# *Ego* #

    Many people like to poke fun at the fragility of the male ego, but it isn't limited to just men. Women, Trans, Fish, whatever you want to consider yourself. Myself included. I've come to the conclusion, that on a base level, many problems faced in today's everyday activity would be null and void if people had a stronger sense of self. I cannot count on my hands(or toes) how many times,
    I've experienced someone get injured physically or emotionally over someone else acting over a hurt ego. Whether it's a bar fight over some macho bullshit, someone shooting an innocent little girl because he brought a gun to a fight, people feeling attacked/threatened by people that don't look like them, or my favorite trope the dude/girl who can't handle being rejected. Now, I am by no means saying that I dont experience the pain that comes with being rejected, or the desire to assert dominance in a bar. BUT I THINK FIRST. Where is the thought that says, maybe I shouldnt key his car because he doesnt love me. Or the thought that says,
    maybe im misattributing the loss of jobs to immigrants, maybe I don't fully understand why African Americans(stereotypically) feel or act in certain ways. It boggles my mind that more people don't have the strength of self to step out of their own shoes. It's problematic.

    Where it comes from? I have no idea. In a more immediate sense, I'm sure parenting/genetics and environmental factors have plenty to do with it. In a greater sense, I think part of it has to do with the fact that we are forced into very narrow views of ourselves. Black or White, Tall or Short, Gay or Straight, Man or Woman. More recently there have been pushes towards a more fluid sense of self, but that too is plagued with even more labels! Why is there a need to be one thing or the other?
    Why can we not just be? 

# *Life* #

    Now this is something that I have had quite a substantial amount of experience with. Especially within the last few months. I've lost my cat, my father. I've watched my friend lose his mother. And yesterday, I came across a cat dying in the road. Someone ran over this cat, and just kept going. Little guy was laying in a pile of blood, eye bulging out of his head like a toy.

    Life is fragile
    But life is resiliant.
    (That little guy was strong as hell, still up and meowing after all of that trauma.)

    Speaking more towards human life though, life is short.
    Much to short to put it at risk for a sore ego. But long enough to put it at risk for a bit of fun.
