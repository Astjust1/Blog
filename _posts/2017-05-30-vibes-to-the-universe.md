# Let's see if this is true #

They say that when you put a certain vibe out into the universe, the universe rewards you with what you wish for. So here's me putting out vibes. Positive vibes towards starting my career as a software engineer. Im so ready to get my feet off the ground, and start my life as an independent young professional. I'm even more excited to learn more about software engineering as it is on the job. I learn better actually working so I feel that I will excel in that regard. It's hard to market that skill though, it kinda seems like a bit of a cop out.

But yeah, here's to positive vibes for a starting job, and heres to me moving out, and heres to me starting my life out on my own.
