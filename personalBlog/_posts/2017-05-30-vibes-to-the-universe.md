# Let's see if this is true #

They say that when you put a certain vibe out into the universe, the universe rewards you with what you wish for. So here's me putting out vibes. Positive vibes towards starting my career as a software engineer. Im so ready to get my feet off the ground, and start my life as an independent young professional. I'm even more excited to learn more about software engineering as it is on the job. I learn better actually working so I feel that I will excel in that regard. It's hard to market that skill though, it kinda seems like a bit of a cop out.

But yeah, here's to positive vibes for a starting job, and heres to me moving out, and heres to me starting my life out on my own.

I wrote this a while ago actually. And I have some more important vibes that I'd like to throw out there. Not just for myself, but for the world as a whole and for my friends and family.

Mainly just positivity as a whole is the vibe that I want to spread. And I don't mean positivity in the sense that everything is rosy and perfect. I want the type of positivity that encompasses and envelops the negativity, not out of denial, but out of understanding. I want more people to be able to see the bad, and within that bad see the good. Be open to more opportunities in whatever form or facet they come. Just stop being so set in their ways.
