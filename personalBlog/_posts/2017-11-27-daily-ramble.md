# Welcome to today's rant about life #

    This year, has absolutely been the worst year of my life. But life is an odd dichotomy sometimes, because it's also been the best. It's beautiful how the most depressing times make way for the most incredible. Losing my Dad, has been and will continue to be one of the worst things that have ever happened. I'll never again get to ask for his advice, or tease him for hitting on women in bars. He'll never meet any grandkids, or get to watch my brother graduate from college. I'll never get the chance to talk to him about the nice bundle of emotional issues that stem from my childhood. And I will forever cry over his lost chance to continue living. I'm sure there was so much that he wanted to do with his life, and I just hope he didn't have too many regrets in his last moments.

    Talking more to the dichotomy, pop's death was also the spark that lit a fire under me. This has been the best year of my life so far as well. I have made so much progress in all aspects of my life. I've formed closer relationships to my family, built even better bonds with my closest friends, and formed lifelong bonds with people that I never would have expected to. I've gotten closer to my brother again, and getting to watch his emotional growth is the best thing I could have ever asked for. I finally took my first steps into my chosen career. Last but not least, I'm starting to rediscover myself. While this last bit has been quite confusing, it's so much fun. I learn more about myself every day, and I wake up excited for what I'll learn next. I have a good friend who has lost her father to the same disease, and as she said "the personal growth is exponential". How riveting!!

    As I told her recently, I've spent my life wandering the void. Half of me walked out a few years ago, but now I can barely feel any ounce of the apathy, depression, and rage that once consumed me. Granted, now confusion takes up most of that. But joy makes up a great part too! I'm so excited to be alive! But the perfectionist in me will always feel a bit guilty too. I wasn't good enough to share this joy with my father. Now, I know it's not my fault. I am well aware both logically and emotionally that shit just happens sometimes and no one is to blame. But; I put this pressure on myself so that I can share this joy with everyone that I do love and will love. And I will.

    Thanks Dad.
