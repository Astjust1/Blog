I was just having a conversation with someone very dear to me, and she brought up the topic of death. More specifically, how that relates to our purpose in life, and what it means to be a living being and have a "soul".

Now, this is just my view, but I think we misunderstand what a soul is. I don't believe that it's a singular entity. To me, the soul transcends all. Let's take death for example. Most people attribute death to an end of life, but I see it as a continuation. When we die, it's only our physical existence that leaves. Our *essence* lives on in the ways that our absence forces people to grow. The soul is not a thing that we have, the soul is the effect that we have on the people around us, and the effect that we have on others.

The collective feelings that we have,give,and live. That is what the soul is.
