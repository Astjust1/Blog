# HAPPY HOLIDAYS #
## Tis the Season ##
For joy, for cheer, and for reflection. For me, there is quite a lot to reflect on. Plenty of tragedy , but also plenty of happiness. So bear with me, this is gonna be long.

I started the year off with a new opportunity. Working with a great group of guys as a software developer. An intern of sorts I guess you could say. Long story short, I fucked that one up. I treated them very unprofessionally, and caved under the pressure of everything that was going on in my life. For some back story, my Aunt was in and out of diabetic comas due to alcoholism, and she was staying with us to try and keep her from drinking and help her manage her diabetes.And my Dad was staying with us after his chemo treatments. It was a lot, but  I'm going to reach out and apologize to them.

Fast forward through a couple months of "stability" and I get the news that would set my life on a very winding path. I was upstate in Binghamton with some friends. And my Dad called to tell me that his cancer had spread to his lungs.

Fast forward another few months. It's June, my cat had died two weeks previous and I had also very recently seen my Aunt half dead and comatose. But I was trying to troop along. So! I'm about to get on a train for a job interview, and I get a phone call from the doctor telling me that my dad might not make it through the rest of the day.

So I run to the hospital, and get treated with the first of many trauma inducing moments for that day. My Dad, barely capable of forming sentences, had had multiple seizures that he would never recover from. I walked into the room, and apparently the first coherent vocalizations that he had made came through. He looked at me and screamed *NO!* Now, I wont sit here and go into detail about how fucked up it is to watch your father try one last time to protect you from the ultimate reality of life. But it was some serious shit. I absolutely broke.

Thank fuck that my uncle came with me to the hospital. I don't know why, but seeing him break down while watching me fall apart steeled my resolve. My dad had left me and my brother in charge of things, but my brother was two states away in class. So I had to pull myself together, and I did. I made the necessary phone calls. Had to tell friends and family that their loved one may not be here the next day. Had to console the people that showed up and were more beside themselves than I was. I'm getting a headache thinking about how stressful that day was.

Fast forward to around 9pm that night. Most people had come and gone, I had called my brother. I think successfully kept some people's spirits high, and had my last joke with my Dad. This motherfucker, in his barely intelligible speech, looked at me and said: _"I'm gonna body slam you."_. And laughed as I teased and told him to square up, and made fun of him for not even being able to wipe his own ass. I know it sounds harsh, but for the first time that day he actively relaxed after that. I think he was trying to tell me that he was okay. And I think my response told him that I knew that already, and that I was okay too. It's weird, me and my dad hadn't been close since I was a baby. But in that moment, I was 2 again, sitting on the hood of his old Altima and watching the sunset with him. Except this time the sun was setting on his life.

Fast forward a bit through to a few months after the funeral. It's September, and my Dad's passing has left me feeling stuck. I wasn't doing anything with my life, and had no motivation. Some may say that they were signs of depression, which would be right, but I don't think it was in this case. I've been depressed and suicidal and it wasn't that. They way I've been describing it, is as a wake up call. My Dad had always told me that he would be disappointed if I didn't live up to my potential. And I wasn't. So. I quit my job to try and do something.

I spent the next few months trying to find direction, but everything seemed to start to align when I decided to go to therapy. I knew I needed to get through things, and I couldn't do it on my own so I got help. I have to say, Randy has made such an incredible impact on my life. The next 3 months or so have been a whirlwind. But it's ended with a wild amount of personal growth. I landed a job as a Software Engineer. I've come out of my shell, and for once have started to live for myself and for what I want. I've gotten to watch my brother genuinely smile for the first time in such a long time. He's been in so much pain, and he's finally starting to get through it and I'm over the moon. I've reconnected with my family. I had closed myself off emotionally from everyone, specifically my family. The bond I have with my mother is exponentially stronger, I've gotten to know her and my Grandma so much better. My uncle has become such a good friend, and my cousin has started to come out of his shell too. And my friends!! I split away from the big group and decided to focus on the smaller few of my dearest friends and my goodness it feels wonderful to feel such love for people! They are my family just as much as anyone else. And my love life, while tumultuous, is incredible. I've met someone that I really enjoy spending time with, and while the situation is complicated, I couldnt be happier!

So I guess in terms of reflecting on the year as a whole, it's kinda been one big lesson. A fuck you from the universe if you will. Reminding me that life is what you make of it. Not what comes to you. My dad was literally dying, and still had the time to joke. So I needed to stop complaining about the circumstances that I fall into, and realize that I make many of those circumstances as I go. Actions have equal reaction, positivity breeds positivity, whether in the face of darkens or not. So its time to be positive. And to anyone reading this that is feeling lost, or hopeless. Take action, change your circumstance, embrace the challenge. And live your best life.

Happy Holidays
