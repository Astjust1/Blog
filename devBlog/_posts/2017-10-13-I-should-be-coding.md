# But I'm procrastinating #

While procrastinating I discovered an amazing font! [Fira-Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), is a mono-spaced font with something called ligatures. Now, I had absolutely no idea what a ligature was until today; so at least my procrastination was somewhat productive. Anyway, a typographic ligature is a bit of nifty magic where multiple characters combine into a singular character.

Here's some normal code:

    
    <=, >=, =>, !=, !==, ==, ===, ||, &&
    

    (Typing this was confusing for a second since I'm currently using Fira Code)

Here's the updated look:

LOOK HOW COOL THAT IS! SO PRETTY!

Now I'm more motivated to finish what I was working on. Those arrows make Es6 arrow functions look so nice.
