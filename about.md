My name is Armond. This site is an almalgamation of all of my interests and hobbies, with a sprinkle of professional details too.
My interests shift around usually, but right now I'm focused on writing, meditation, running, and trying to get into machine learning.

My professional experience is mostly in web development, with a bit of IOS thrown in.
The technologies that I worked with are:


* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* PostgreSQL
* HTML 
* CSS
* Objective-C

Aside from those, I explore different technologies in my free time, like React Native.
